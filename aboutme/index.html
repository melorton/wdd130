    <h2>Melissa Orton</h2>
    <p>My husband and I just celebrated our 27th anniversary.  We have moved 15 times in those 27 years.  Currently we are living in Utah. </p>
    <p> I am the mother to three girls whom I homeschooled through their elementary and high school educations. Homeschooling was a lot of work but also a lot of fun! I recently became an empty nester, so I decided that now is a good time to return to college and finish a bachelor’s degree. </p> 
    <p>got my associates of science from BYUI when it was Ricks college.  I am currently planning to get a bachelor’s degree in web development and design.  It is a little out of my comfort zone but I think it is important to stay up to date with technology and I am hoping that this will help me to do that.</p> 
    <p>I am a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  I was fortunate to be born in the covenant.  In my teen years I remember complaining to my mom about this.  I told her that I felt my testimony would be stronger if I had been a convert because I would have had to work harder to know for myself if the gospel is true.  Of course, I now know that we all have different paths to conversion and that a strong testimony is available to all who have a desire to know and are willing to work for it.</p>
