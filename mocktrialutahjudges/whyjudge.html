        <h1 class="why_judge">Why Judge Mock Trial?</h1>
                
        <p class="p2">Each year we average 110 mock trials throughout the state. Each trial consists of three judges;  a head judges and two supporting judges. This means that we need 330 volunteers to help with judging every year! As you can imagine, finding enough volunteers to judge is one of the most challenging aspects of the Mock Trial program. We have worked closely with various colleges as well as the State Bar Association to help making volunteering worth your time.</p>
