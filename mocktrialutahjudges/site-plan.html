        The Mock Trial competition is part of Utah Law Related Education whose goal is to empower Utah's students by engaging unique programs promoting understanding of the law, the legal system, and our rights and responsibilities as engaged citizens.

        The Utah Mock Trial competition was established in 1980 to teach students their rights and responsibilities as citizens. Each year, volunteer attorneys write or adapt a legal case involving issues of interest to youth. A handbook containing established facts, signed affidavits, and other legal information regarding the case, along with the rules and information related to the tournament, is provided for all participants. Team members play roles of witnesses, attorneys, clerks, and bailiffs in courtrooms throughout the state.
        The Mock Trial Competition is open to all public and private secondary schools in Utah. Each year, more than 1,000 students, 80 teachers, 350 attorneys, and 100 community representatives participate in over 110 mock trials statewide. The high school championship team participates in the national mock trial competition

      <h3>Why Judge?</h3>
      <p>Each year we average 110 mock trials throughout the state.  Each trial consists of three judges â€“ a head judges and two supporting judges.  This means that we need 330 volunteers to help with judging every year!  As you can imagine, finding enough volunteers to judge is one of the most challenging aspects of the Mock Trial program.  We have worked closely with various colleges as well as the State Bar Association to help making volunteering worth your time.</p>
      <p> <ul>
        Benefits of judging
      <li>If you are an attorney, it is the easiest 4 hours of CLE credit you can earn.</li>
      <li>If you are a law student at the University of Utah you receive pro bono credit.</li>
      <li> If you are a political science or criminal justice student at Weber State, University of Utah, or Utah Valley you can earn extra credit.</li>
      <li>It is a good opportunity to mingle with other legal professionals. </li>
      <li>It makes you feel good to contribute to your community.</li>
      <li>You are helping to educate and influence students about the legal process.</li>
      <li>Sometimes we give you free food!</li>

      <h3>Judges Training</h3>
      <P>We have found it most effective to provide online training videos so that judges can watch them at their own convenience.  We do ask that you watch these videos prior to arriving to judge so that if you do have any questions that are not addressed in the videos that you have time to ask them before the trials start.

        We have a refined process for scoring and submitting the ballots electronically.  This streamlined process has received rave reviews from both judges and coaches.
        
        Below you will see a video that explain how to fill out and submit a ballot.  There is also a video that instructs you on what to look for when you are judging a trial.  This video includes Mock Trial rules and procedures that you need to be aware of. 
        </P>

        (Insert various YouTube training videos, including how to judge, how to use the electronic ballots, and possibly how to submit hours for CLE credit, pro bono credit, extra credit)
